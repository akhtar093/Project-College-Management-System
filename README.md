The project idea is to create a College Management Database using SQL. The database includes entities such as Student, Branch, Books, Issues, User, Login, Permission, and Roles, with various attributes for each entity. The ER diagrams provided illustrate the relationships among the tables and highlight primary and foreign keys. The project aims to provide beginners with hands-on experience in creating a database schema, understanding relationships, and executing SQL queries to fetch relevant data. Tables: The database includes several tables such as student, books, branch, user, issues, login, roles, and permission, each serving a specific purpose.

Relationships: Tables are interconnected using foreign key constraints to establish relationships between them. For example, the issues table has foreign keys referencing books and student tables.

Data Population: Data is inserted into the tables to simulate a library environment. This includes information about students, books, branches, users, issued books, and login credentials.

Functionalities: The database seems to support functionalities like issuing books to students, managing user roles and permissions, and tracking book details.
